```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


Create a function that contains a *while* loop
```{r}
# if a population decreases by 2% annually, how long will it take for the species to go extinct if the current population is 2000 individuals?


# initial conditions
yr = 1
pop_size = 2000

yrs_to_extinction = function(pop_size, yr) {
# while loop
while ((pop_size > 1) && (yr < 1000))  {
# decrease pop
pop_size = pop_size - 0.02 * pop_size 
# measure time
yr = yr + 1
}
}

pop_size
yr

```


Create another function that uses *case_when*
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
# function purpose: inform the threat status of a species based on population size and population growth rate

#Species is critically endangered if population is less that 100 and growth is less than 1
#Species is threatened if population is greater than 100 and growth is less than 1
#Species is least concern if groeth is greater than 1

# some fake data to try the function
population = runif(min = 1, max = 2000, n = 100)
growth = runif(min = 0, max = 2, n = 100)

species_classification = function(population, growth) {
  
# start with some error checking
if (population <= 1) {
   return("Population is Extinct") }
  
  else{
# into the statement
  if (growth < 1) {
   status = case_when(population <= 100 ~ "critically endangered",
                     population > 100 ~ "threatened")
  } 
  else {
    status = "least concern" }
  }
  return(status)
}

status <- mapply(species_classification, population, growth)

status

```
